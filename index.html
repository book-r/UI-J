      <h1>Our Vision</h1>
      <div class='right'>
        <img src="./content/svg/undraw_Bibliophile_hwqc.svg">

        <p>There was never really a social hub dedicated to text-books, so we created our platform to bring together
          like-minded individuals who are not aversed to
          voicing their real opinions and experiences with the books they have used in the past. We strive to provide a
          positive environment for our users to interact
          in while cutting out the clutter of other types of books.
